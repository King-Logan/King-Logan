Hi there! I'm Logan. I'm a Senior pursuing a B.A. in computer science and a minor in digital media studies at the University of Minnesota. Iâ€™m interested in the new world of gamification, applying game fundamentals such as achievements and sources of engagement to other aspects of life to make things more enjoyable. I plan to utilize my degree to create software to better people, and make some of the less enjoyable things in life more enjoyable.
